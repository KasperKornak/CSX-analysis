# CSX-analysis
Analysis conducted using data from CSX Investor Relations team, company's 10-Ks, 10-Qs and various websites. All used data can be found either in `datasources` directory or in `scripts/charts.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. `CSX_analysis.pdf` contains the analysis and I recommend to download it and read locally, as GitHub compresses it and reduces the resolution of charts when viewing online. 

**This is not an investment advice.**
